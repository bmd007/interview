## KING
### GAME SCORE TRACKER 

### main points:
    * need for a thread safe data structure
    * need for a data structure supporting sort on write in order to have an efficient highscorelist end point
    * could have mocked repostiory and tested ScoreResource isolatedly but skipped it due to limited logic involved
