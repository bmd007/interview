# SBAB interview notes:
```
Interviews:

What you have prepared for Klarna's interview is really useful everywhere.
Complete stories, with discussions and morals and bit of fun:
Conflicts
Failures
Expectations

The reason to change job is that you:
	Are buying a new place
	Need a new work permit 
	â€¦

But  NOT bad things about the current company


Feedback from manager and other team members




With SBAB, you need to be patient, relax 
You need to give and take feedback 
You need to be open for experimentation
You need to have new ideas for improvement 
Be the good version of yourself but not much obsessed 
```
